# Including an Existing Native Theme

Let's say you already have a native Keycloak Login theme in ( FreeMarker, theme.properties) and you want to use Keycloakify to create an Account theme or an Admin theme.  \
It is possible to repatriate your theme sources into your Keycloakify project.  \
Keycloakify will bundle your theme theme into the final .JAR file.&#x20;

To do that just put your existing theme in `src/login` or `src/account` or `src/email`. &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
I will elaborate on this shortly.
