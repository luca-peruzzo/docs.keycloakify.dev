In this approach you'll use your favorite styling solution it can be:

* Plain CSS
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply)
* A language superset of CSS lile [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or [Less](https://lesscss.org/)
* An utility class based CSS framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Fundation](https://get.foundation/)
