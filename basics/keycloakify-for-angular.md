# Keycloakify for Angular

## Using Angular with Keycloakify

Efforts have been made to integrate **Angular** with **Keycloakify**, providing two starter projects to help you get started:

* [Keycloakify Starter Angular](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter-angular)
* [Keycloakify Starter Angular Vite](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter-angular-vite)

### Important Considerations

* **Keycloakify Commands**: All standard Keycloakify commands, such as `npx keycloakify eject-page`, are fully supported. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out on the [Keycloakify Discord server](https://discord.gg/).

## Component Scaffolding

A key difference is that the components are scaffolded. For example, when you eject the register page, all dependent components it relies on—such as `password-wrapper`—are also ejected.
